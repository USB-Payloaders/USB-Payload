USB-Payload
===========
In this project we will create a RAT that injected by malicious keyboard.
The project is divided to 3 sectors:

1.The malicious keyboard software - Knows when user left the dock, connects to ftp, downloads virus and runs it.

2.The RAT - Nothing special.

3.A package manager - The RAT will download packages from a remote server to allow us control the dock specifically to our needs.
